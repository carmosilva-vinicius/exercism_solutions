# My Exercism Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to exercises from the Exercism platform. It serves as a reference and a showcase of my problem-solving skills in various programming languages.

My main goal is to study C#, but I study some languages with different approaches to improme my range of knowledge:

- C# as a language running on a Virtual Machine (VM)
- Elixir as a Functional language
- Rust as a Compiled language
-  Python as an Interpreted language

   
## Structure
   
The solutions in this repository are organized by the programming language of the exercise. Each language has its own directory, and within each directory, you'll find individual directories for each exercise.
   
## Usage

To view a solution, navigate to the directory of the programming language and then to the directory of the specific exercise. Each solution includes the original problem statement, my solution, and any notes or reflections I made while solving the exercise.
